### Usage

When a player dies it triggers the dead state.

The death state also invokes a meta change client-side and on server-side.

After the change is invoked. A timer is started and updated frequently until the player's timer hits zero. After zero a player may type `/accpetdeath` to fully revive at a hospital.

A hospital is determined by closest to the dead player.
