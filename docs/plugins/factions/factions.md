### Abstract

The faction system is a grouping system for admins to help player's group people together. It can be used for gangs, factions, businesses, etc. The current iteration of Factions **does not** have any built-in factions. You will have to create them yourself.

üìÅ `src/core/plugins/core-factions/`

There is already built-in group management, rank management, bank management, etc.

::: warning
Currently the Faction Administrative tools are very limited. It's heavily database based.

:::

### Configuration

The current configuration for factions is confusing and will be rather difficult. In the near future it will hopefully be resolved but I can at least state how to handle factions a bit better.

::: warning

When you modify a faction in a database you **must** restart the server.

:::

See the sidebar for Configuration sections.

### Usage

An admin can create a faction by doing `/fcreate faction_name_here`.

An faction owner can invite others by performing `/finvite ingame_id_here`.

A player can accept an invite by typing `/faccept`.

A player in a faction can open the panel by typing `/fopen`.

An admin may join another faction by doing `/fjoin faction_uid_here`.

An admin may overwrite faction ownership by joinig a faction and performing `/fsetowner ingame_id_here`.
